Cookies- Express Sessions
----------------------------
-> Cookies are a way for the server to track clients , and also for clients to send small piece of information to the server;
-> Express Sessions are a way of managing user sessions on the server side;
-> Since the server side is designed to be stateless, and hence server can get client status via cookies or express sessions;

HTTP Cookies
-----------
-> Small piece od data sent from a web server and stored on the client side;
-> Each subsequent request from the client side includes the cookie in the request header;

Express and Cookies
--------------------
-> Server can set cookie as follows in any middleware:
res.cookie(name, value, options)
-> Cookies are parsed in Express server using the cookie-parser middleware
  var cookieParse = require('cookie-parser');
  app.use(cookieParser());
-> Cookie-parser parsees incoming cookies and attaches them to request;
  req.cookies.name;

Express and Signed Cookies
--------------------------
-> Ordinary cookies can be forged and hence cookies are digitally signed;
* Signed cookie: signed with a secret key on the server side;
    - Digital signature with key-hash message authentication code (verifiable);
* Cookie parser supports signed cookies:
  var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
  app.use(cookieParser('secret key'));
* Parserd signed cookies made available as:
  req.signedCookies.name
 
 Express Sessions
 ------------------
 -> Used to track user session
    * combination of cookie with session id and server-side storage of information indexed by session id;
    * Session information:
      - Stored by default in-memory (wiped out when the server restarts);
      - Stored in permanent store on server side;
      - Distributed session store if usingf multiple replicated servers;
